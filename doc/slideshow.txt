--slide-show

The option --slide-show adds the possibility to display a slide shown up to the score. 
This slide show is composed of a set of png files 
  - sharing a common prefix (for example "/path/to/dir/slide-")
  - having each one a suffix with the format "0000.0000.png", giving 
    the offset (in quarters) when the image must be displayed.

For example, given these files:
  /path/to/dir/slide-0000.0000.png
  /path/to/dir/slide-0000.0050.png
  /path/to/dir/slide-0008.0025.png

with the command:
  ly2video --slide-show "/path/to/dir/slide-" ...

The first file will be displayed at the begining of the score. 
The second one replaces the first one at offset 0.5000 (one eighth after the start), and so on.
