# ly2video

ly2video is a Python script which converts music represented by a [GNU
LilyPond](http://lilypond.org) file into a video containing a
horizontally scrolling music staff which is synchronized with a
MIDI-generated audio rendering of the music.

## Examples

Here are some [examples of videos generated by ly2video](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfRwjd606WZlxRU_kaUPagX3-Uv-SYRMH).

## Requirements

* GNU LilyPond >= 2.15.41 (needs `one-line-breaking` support)
* FFmpeg
* TiMidity++
* Python 2.7
* Python modules (see next section for installation hints):
    * [Python Imaging Library](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/) (only tested with 1.1.7)
    * [pyPdf](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyPdf) (only tested with 1.13)
    * a [patched](https://github.com/aspiers/python-midi) version of [`midi`](https://github.com/vishnubob/python-midi) (only tested with 0.2.2)
* ALSA development libraries (`python-midi` requires these to build)
    * on SUSE-based distributions: `sudo zypper install alsa-devel`
    * on Debian/Ubuntu-based distributions: `sudo apt-get install libasound-dev`

## Installation

Ensure that you have installed the above dependencies.  If you have
Python's [pip installer](http://www.pip-installer.org) installed, the
Python modules can be installed system-wide via:

    sudo pip install -r pip-requires.txt

or for the current user via:

    pip install --user -r pip-requires.txt

You can optionally protect against the risk of installation of these
Python modules destabilising any other Python applications you may
use, by isolating them in a virtual environment using
[`virtualenv`](http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/).  The most
convenient way to do this is via
[`virtualenvwrapper`](http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).
Once you have `virtualenvwrapper` installed, it's as simple as:

    mkvirtualenv ly2video
    pip install -r pip-requires.txt

## Usage

Run `ly2video.py --help` to display usage information.

## Support, bugs, development etc.

Please check the [issue tracker](https://github.com/aspiers/ly2video/issues)
for known issues, and if yours is not there, please submit it.
I can't guarantee that I'll be able to fix it, or even respond,
but I'll try, and even if I can't help, this is github, so anyone else
can potentially help you out too.

If you know how to fix a problem or contribute an enhancement, you are
extremely welcome to [fork this repository](https://github.com/aspiers/ly2video/fork_select),
commit your fix, and then send a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)!

## Acknowledgements

Huge credits for the initial implementation go to Jiří "FireTight"
Szabó, who wrote it as part of his Bachelor's degree.  If you are
lucky enough to understand Czech, you can read his thesis on ly2video
in the `doc/thesis/` subdirectory, or
[online](http://is.muni.cz/th/359741/fi_b/text_prace.pdf) :-) Work on
an English translation has begun but is unlikely to be finished any
time soon unless someone else volunteers to help out.
