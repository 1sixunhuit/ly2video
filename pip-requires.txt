# The upstream repository still has an unmerged pull
# request fixing a significant tempo calculation bug:
# https://github.com/vishnubob/python-midi/pull/6
#git+git://github.com/vishnubob/python-midi.git#egg=midi

# whereas my fork has the pull request merged in:
git+git://github.com/aspiers/python-midi.git#egg=midi

# Once https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/526 is completed,
# this should work instead, for anyone who wants to
# concurrently hack on python-midi:
#-e git+git://github.com/aspiers/python-midi.git#egg=midi&subdirectory=src
